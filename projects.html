                  <p> Project 1: Poem </p>
                  <p> In this project, I formatted one of my favorite childhood poems by Shel Silverstein. This project linked the author to the online source of the poem through a simple html link. At the bottom, it also states the publishing company, and any copyright information. This project was a lot of fun to complete because it allowed me to reminisce on my favorite childhood memories.</p>

                  <p> Project 1: Poem </p>
                  <p> In this project, I created a mock music player, styled similarly to iTunes. Within it, three languages (html, css, and javascript) were used to create every aspect of a music player. It included albums, song lists, as well as a song player that had functioning play/pause buttons, skip and rewind buttons, a timer, as well as volume levels. While the volume did not actually change, the songs did not actually play, and rewind and skip only worked for going to the previous or next song, the music player imitated all visual aspects of a music player. This project was really exciting to me because it allowed to employ all lessons I had learned from html, css, and javascript to create. It was very rewarding to see hours of coding and rearranging end up with a successful final product.</p>
