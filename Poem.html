      <p class = "stanza"> I tripped on my shoelace</p>

      <p class = "stanza"> And I fell up --- </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> Up to the roof tops, </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> Up over the town, </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> Up past the tree tops, </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> Up over the mountains, </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> Up where the colors </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> Blend into the sounds. </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> But it got me so dizzy </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> When I looked around, </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> I got sick to my stomach </p>

      <p class = "stanza"> And I threw down. </p>
