            <h1> BIO </h1>
            <p> My name is Stephanie Waldstein. I am a senior at Northwestern University in the Robert R McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. I am an Industrial Engineering and Managerial Sciences Major.
               On campus I am involved in a few extracurriculars. I am a member of the Alpha Phi Sorority, and was Vice President of Community Relations and Vice President of Risk Managment during my Sophomore year. This year I am a Director of Formal Recruitment for my sorority. I also am part of the Women's Club Lacrosse Team playing defense!
              I am on the board of Hillel at Northwestern, as part of Hillel International, as well as participating as a Jewish Greek Life Ambassador for 2 years. This summer I will be a Public Sector Cloud Solutions Consulting Intern. </p>
              <p> Outside from school I love to travel and be outdoors. I recently studied abroad for a semester in Wellington, New Zealand. It was an extraordinary experience to see such beauty. I absolutely love to be outdoors and do outdoor activities such as hiking, running, and snowboarding. Getting to do all 3 in such an incredible place was
              such an amazing experience. Family wise, I am the youngest of 3 daughters, each of us 3 years younger than one another. I have a mother who is an ophthalmologist and a dad who is a cardiologist. I also have a 5 month old puppy, named Fauci, who was welcomed into the family during quarantine! Together as a family we love to go on walks and bike rides, travel to the Jersey Shore in the summer, and celebrate holidays with our extended family!</p>
              <p> Some fun facts: My favorite color is blue, teal to be more specific. Dogs are my favorite pet and make me so happy. As of recent, I have decided that sweet potatoes are probably my favorite food. I love to read and welcome any book suggestions. I also love documentaries/docu-series about worldy topics, even if sad or violent. Lastly, I was born into a very, very funny family and was given zero funny genes. It has taken a few (21) years but I have finally accepted that I am not funny.</p>
              <p> Thanks for reading! </p>
